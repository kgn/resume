[GitHub](http://github.com/kgn) | [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/kgn) | [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_kgn)

I am a developer/designer and love being able to marry the two with a dash of user experience! I love designing an application or website in Photoshop and making it come alive in code. I have been programming for the web for over 10 years and for the Mac and iOS since the iPhone SDK was released. I am proficient in a number of languages most notably being: objective-c, coffeescript/javascript, and python. I am an active member of both communities, [doing interviews](http://www.objectivesee.com/david.keegan.html), contributing open source to GitHub and posting work on Dribbble. I am also a contributor to the design focused blog [*The Industry*](http://theindustry.cc/author/david/) and also write design and development related posts for my [personal blog](http://kgn.github.com).

[Blizzard Entertainment](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/) is a video game company known world wide for its award winning titles like *World of Warcraft*, *Star Craft*, and *Diablo*.

During my time at Blizzard I was a software engineer for the cinematics team working on everything from animation to rendering, creating tools used by artists, websites for approvals, and api's for other programmers.

The most recent project I worked on was a ground up re-write of the lighting tool. This tool is a desktop application with the front end written completely with HTML, CSS/SASS, and coffeescript/javascript running inside of a custom build of chromium. My primary role on this team was to design the user interface/experience and build out most of it as well as build core functionality into the application.

My responsibility on this show was the creation of software and pipelines for taking digital assets from concept paintings to final renders.

In this role I developed software and webpages for story boarding, an asset managements system with pdf batch exporting for outsourced contractors, and an approval website for the director and Nickelodeon executives to approve characters and concepts remotely.

### Omation | Barnyard Movie

[Barnyard](http://www.barnyardmovie.com) was a children's animated movie released by Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures.

My responsibilities on this project included managing a server farm for rendering the movie and optimizing the throughput of the animated scenes to rendered final frames.

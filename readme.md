*I love beautiful interfaces and code bases!*

I am a developer/designer and love being able to marry the two with a dash of user experience! I am passionate about pixel-perfect interfaces and icons and enjoy designing an app or website in Photoshop and making it come alive in code. I have been programming for the web for over 10 years and for the Mac and iOS since the iPhone SDK was released. I am proficient in a number of languages most notably being: *objective-c*, *coffeescript/javascript*, and *python*. I am an active member in both the design and development communities, [doing interviews](http://www.objectivesee.com/david.keegan.html), contributing open source to GitHub and posting work on Dribbble. I am a contributor to the design focused blog [*The Industry*](http://theindustry.cc/author/david/) and also write design and development related posts for my [personal blog](http://kgn.github.com).

## Employment

### Blizzard Entertainment
*February 2007 - May 2012*

[Blizzard Entertainment](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/) is a video game company known world wide for its award winning titles: *World of Warcraft*, *Star Craft*, and *Diablo*.

Over the past 5 years at Blizzard I have been a software engineer on the Cinematics team. This work has reached a wide gamut of technologies and disciplines. Everything from animation to rendering, creating tools used by artists, websites for approvals, and API's.

Currently I am on the team responsible for writing a new in-house lighting tool. This tool is a desktop application with the front end written completely with HTML, CSS/SASS, and coffeescript/javascript running inside of a webkit frame. My primary role on this team is to design and implement much of the user interface/experience, but I also contribute to the core of the application as well.

### O Entertainment | Back at the Barnyard
*July 2006 - February 2007*

[Back at the Barnyard](http://nicktoons.nick.com/shows/back-at-the-barnyard/) was a television show based on the *Barnyard Movie* that aired on Nickelodeon.

My responsibility on this show was the creation of software and pipelines for taking digital assets from concept paintings to final renders.

In this role I developed software and webpages for story boarding, an asset managements system with pdf batch exporting for outsourced contractors, and an approval website for the director and Nickelodeon executives to review characters and concepts remotely.

### Omation | Barnyard Movie
*August 2005 - July 2006*

[Barnyard](http://www.barnyardmovie.com) was a children's animated movie released by Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures.

My responsibilities on this project included managing a server farm for rendering the movie and optimizing the throughput of the animated scenes to rendered final frames.

In this role I created several tools and webpages for visualizing the render farm activity and trouble shooting animation scenes that failed to render.

I am a developer/designer and love being able to marry the two with a dash of user experience! I find this to be an extremely beneficial union for fast iteration, often quickly swapping back  and forth between Photoshop and Xcode to make sure the layout, colors, typography and icons are just right. Interactions and the way things move is so important to design language now, again I find this union to be a perfect fit for envisioning and executing not only the static design but realizing how it will work and look in motion.

I am heavily active in the design and development communities. I contribute regularly to Open Source projects, speak at conferences and on podcasts, and chat regularly with some of the top designers and developers in the industry.

### Personal Products

I've released several products independently to both the iOS and Mac App Stores. Most notably on the Mac App Store is my app [Play by Play](http://playbyplayapp.com) which received a *9/10* from [mac.appstorm.net](http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/graphics/dribbble-on-your-desktop-with-play-by-play/) and was featured by Apple on the Mac App Store in *New and Noteworthy* in February 2012, again in September 2012, and was selected as one of the 28 apps to represent "Apps Enhanced for OSX Mountain Lion". On the iOS App Store my app [Notable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notable-contact-notes-made/id582095892?mt=8) is a great way to keep notes on everyone you meet and [Hark](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hark-quick-text-to-speech/id715455614?mt=8) uses text to speech to help proofread important messages.

### 1kLabs
*January 2013 - Present*

1kLabs is a startup/incubator I co-founded with some friends. We've focused on mobile social photo sharing apps and have released two to date. The first app was release in July 2013 and is a photo sharing app where users post photos of people, places, and things for their friends to guess called [Sesame](http://playsesame.com). Sesame was selected as one of the 10 apps shown at the [Parse Developer Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBIEURobVx4#t=2680) in 2013. The second was released in November 2013 is a photo sharing app that allows users to share photos with beautiful hashtag overlays called [#Hashup](http://www.gohashup.com). I lead design and development for both of these products.

### SignNow
*May 2012 - October 2013*

[SignNow](http://signnow.com) is a digital document signing startup based out of Newport Beach that allows users to easily sign documents on their mobile device or the web as well as streamline the process of collecting signatures from multiple signers.

While at SignNow I led iOS design & development. In addition to designing and developing the app utilized all of my skills and talents to help streamline and promote the product. I shot beautiful photographs of the app for marketing and tutorial content. Wrote a build system from scratch that automatically built the app and distributed it to the team for testing. I also led many of the in-person user experience tests we ran on the product to help refine new features.

### Blizzard Entertainment
*February 2007 - May 2012*

[Blizzard Entertainment](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/) is a video game company known world wide for its award winning titles: *World of Warcraft*, *Star Craft*, and *Diablo*.

For just over 5 years I was a software engineer on the Cinematics team. This work reached a wide gamut of technologies and disciplines. Everything from animation to rendering, creating tools used by artists, websites for approvals, and API's.

The last team I worked on was responsible for writing a new in-house lighting tool. This was a desktop application with the front end written completely with HTML, CSS/SASS, and coffeescript/javascript running inside of a webkit frame. My primary role on this team was to design and implement much of the user interface/experience, but I also contributed to the core of the application as well.

### O Entertainment | Back at the Barnyard
*July 2006 - February 2007*

[Back at the Barnyard](http://nicktoons.nick.com/shows/back-at-the-barnyard/) was a television show based on the *Barnyard Movie* that aired on Nickelodeon.

My responsibility on this show was the creation of software and pipelines for taking digital assets from concept paintings to final renders.

In this role I developed software and webpages for story boarding, an asset managements system with pdf batch exporting for outsourced contractors, and an approval website for the director and Nickelodeon executives to review characters and concepts remotely.

### Omation | Barnyard Movie
*August 2005 - July 2006*

[Barnyard](http://www.barnyardmovie.com) was a children's animated movie released by Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures.

My responsibilities on this project included managing a server farm for rendering the movie and optimizing the throughput of the animated scenes to rendered final frames.

In this role I created several tools and webpages for visualizing the render farm activity and trouble shooting animation scenes that failed to render.
